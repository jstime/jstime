# Contributing to jstime

First off, thank you so much for considering contributing to jstime. This is a scrappy project trying to make JavaScript runtimes fun. The scope and direction of the project is fairly limited at this time, but any contributions are greatly appreciated.

## [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

The jstime project has a [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). All
individuals participating in the jstime repo and organization will be
expected to abide by the Code of Conduct. Violating the Code of Conduct
will result in action ranging from a conversation about behavior to
being permanently banned from the jstime organization.

### The Spirit of the law

Not all interactions that require remediation are clear violations
of the Code of Conduct. Project maintainers will take appropriate
action, when neccessary, to ensure the jstime community is a space
where individuals can comfortably collaborate and bring their
entire selves. Unfortunately, if bringing your entire self is
infringing on others from doing the same, you may be asked to leave.

## Pull Requests

If you would like to make a change open a Pull Request.

Project maintainers will do their best to review and land code
in a reasonable time frame.

All Pull Requests require CI to be green to land.

It is possible that some Pull Requests may be rejected. The project
maintainers will make best effort to explain why a Pull Request is
rejected in a timely manner.
