# jstime Project Governance

For the curent list of Collaborators see the project [README](./README.md)

This governance document is heavily by the
[governance of the node.js project](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md)

## Collaborators

jstime Collaborators maintain the [jstime/jstime][] repository. The GitHub team for
jstime Collaborators is @jstime/collaborators. Collaborators have:

* Commit access to the [jstime/jstime][] repository
* Ability to nominate, and vote for, the position of chair

Both Collaborators and non-Collaborators may propose changes to the jstime source
code. The mechanism to propose such a change is a GitHub pull request. Collaborators
review and merge (land) pull requests.

One Collaborator must approve a pull request before the pull request can land.
Approving a pull request indicates that the Collaborator accepts responsibility for
the change. Approval must be from Collaborators who are not authors of the change.

*Note*: Approval is not required for changes related to documentation, tooling, or releases

If a Collaborator opposes a proposed change, then the change cannot land unless
the chair determines there is [rough consensus][] to move forward.

See:

* [List of Collaborators](./README.md#current-project-team-members)

### Collaborator Activies

* Helping users and novice contributors
* Contributing code and documentation changes that improve the project
* Reviewing and commenting on issues and pull requests
* Merging pull requests

## Chair

The chair has a sole additional responsibility beyond other collaborators, to
determine when rough consensus has been reached. It is imperative that the chair
remain impartial and fair in this decision making process. Collaborators have the
ability to nominate a new chair at any time who can be ratified either through
rough consensus or a super majority vote.

## Collaborator nominations

Existing Collaborators can nominate someone to become a Collaborator.

To nominate a new Collaborator, start a private thread in the
[@jstime/collaborators team discussions](https://github.com/orgs/jstime/teams/collaborators). Include a short summary of why you would like to add them as a collaborator.

The nomination passes if no Collaborators oppose it after one week. Otherwise, the nomination fails.

## Consensus seeking process

The jstime project follows a [rough consensus][] decision-making model. The IETF
have an excellent [RFC on rough consensus](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7282).
